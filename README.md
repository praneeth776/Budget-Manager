# Huffman Coding

## ðŸ“œ Project Description
This project implements **Huffman Coding**, a widely-used lossless data compression algorithm. It is based on creating variable-length codes for characters, with shorter codes assigned to more frequent characters. This approach minimizes the overall storage requirements.

Huffman Coding is commonly used in file compression formats such as ZIP and image formats like JPEG.
